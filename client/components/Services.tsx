                    When you make a purchase through Deal Rockets, we understand
                    the importance of trust and reliability in every
                    transaction. If the products you receive are defective,
                    incorrect, damaged, or fail to match the agreed
                    specifications, our team immediately steps in to help you
                    connect directly with the seller and resolve the issue as
                    quickly as possible.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    This resolution may include arranging a product replacement,
                    initiating corrections to meet agreed standards, or
                    facilitating a mutually agreed refund â€” all handled directly
                    between you and the seller for maximum control and
                    flexibility.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    In cases where returns are required, we assist you in
                    navigating the process, helping with clear communication,
                    documentation, and coordination so that you avoid delays and
                    confusion. Our goal is to ensure that any disputes are
                    settled fairly, efficiently, and with your satisfaction as
                    the priority.

                    about price â€” it's about getting the right terms, quality,
                    and timelines that meet your exact needs. At Deal Rockets,
                    our Negotiation Support service ensures you have the right

                  <p>
                    We facilitate direct, clear discussions between you and the
                    seller, covering key details such as product specifications,
                    quantities, delivery schedules, and final pricing. By
                    helping both parties align on expectations and
                    responsibilities early on, we reduce the risk of
                    misunderstandings that could disrupt your order.

                  <p>
                    Our experienced team can also guide you through
                    counter-offers, specification adjustments, and alternative
                    solutions when challenges arise. The result is a smoother,
                    faster negotiation process that protects your interests,
                    builds strong supplier relationships, and ensures successful
